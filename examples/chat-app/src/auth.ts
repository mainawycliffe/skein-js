// Custom auth for the example server, authored against `@langchain/langgraph-sdk`'s `Auth` — the
// exact API LangGraph Platform uses, so this file is drop-in. skein loads it from `langgraph.json`'s
// `auth.path` and applies it to every request across the whole Agent Protocol surface.
//
// Posture: open in local dev, enforced in prod. With no `SKEIN_API_KEY` set the server stays open
// (every caller is `demo-user`) AND threads are NOT owner-scoped, so `skein dev` needs no setup and
// threads created before you enabled auth stay visible. Set `SKEIN_API_KEY` to require an `X-Api-Key`
// header (the browser sends it via `useStream({ apiKey })`); that also turns on `@auth.on("threads")`
// ownership scoping, so a caller only sees and mutates their own threads and runs — as on LangGraph
// Platform. (Turning scoping on hides threads that predate it, since they carry no `owner` metadata.)
